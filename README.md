## Final Project
***
This repository belongs to the final project of the Data Science course at IT Academy (Barcelona Activa). The main objective of the project is to predict the future pollution in the city center of Barcelona if no environmental measures or policies are implemented. To achieve this, knowledge in data analysis and data science acquired during the course has been applied.

All the steps followed in the project are explained in the repository; one simply needs to follow the provided order.

### Abstract
***
Urban pollution represents one of the most pressing environmental challenges today. As cities grow and develop, uncontrolled emissions of atmospheric pollutants become a threat to public health and the environment. Vehicles, industry, and other anthropogenic sources release contaminant particles such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), as well as volatile organic compounds.

The final project of the IT Academy Data Science course focuses on predicting the future concentration of pollutants in the center of Barcelona if current levels are maintained. To achieve this, a dataset covering the concentration of various pollutants (CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2) in Barcelona from 2018 to 2020 will be utilized. In addition to machine learning techniques, such as data splitting and supervised regression algorithms, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to understand the distribution and trends of pollutants over time.

With this approach, the project aims to demonstrate the utility of data-driven solutions, the use of machine learning for environmental issues, raise awareness about the need to improve air quality in cities, and motivate initiatives that promote environmental quality improvement in Barcelona.

### Objectives
***
- Conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the evolution of pollutant concentrations in Barcelona.
- Implement machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between variables and forecast the future concentration of pollutants, evaluating the effectiveness of the models with relevant metrics.
- Develop predictive models with Python that support informed decision-making.

### Dataset
***
The project is based on a dataset obtained from the Generalitat de Catalunya, specifically from the Dades Obertes (Open Data) department. This dataset covers records of various air pollutants in the city of Barcelona, more specifically from the monitoring station in l'Eixample, during the period from 2018 to 2023. The data was extracted from the website (2023): https://analisi.transparenciacatalunya.cat/en/Medi-Ambient/Qualitat-de-l-aire-als-punts-de-mesurament-manuals/qg74-87s9/about_data

### Data Science
***
In this project, the acquired knowledge from the course will be autonomously applied, focusing on two fundamental phases: data analysis and the application of machine learning algorithms.
